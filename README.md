I created an **Intro Component with Sign-up Form** as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1) challenge. This modern sign-up form features a responsive design, interactive elements, and form validation to ensure correct form details.
